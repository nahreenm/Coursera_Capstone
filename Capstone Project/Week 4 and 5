Part 2: Data
The project uses two datasets, namely shanghai_demo and shanghai_data.

shanghai_demo contains demographic information of all 16 districts (区) in Shanghai. It has 6 variables: District, Population Density, Salary, Home Price, GDP and GDP Per Capita.

In shanghai_demo dataset, District is a character column. It lists Shanghai's 16 districts. Population Density (person/square kilometer) is density of population in 2017 (data source: Shanghai Statistical Yearbook 2018). Salary (RMB/month) stands for personal monthly salary in 2019 (data source: Sohu). Home Price (RMB/square meter) is from the same source (Sohu). GDP (billion RMB) column has district level GDP in 2018 (data source: Sohu). Finally, GDP Per Capita (RMB) (year 2017 data) is sourced from 好金贵财经.

Note that all data are from different sources and are in different years. This is because it is extremely hard to find one single source that provides related district-level data. This is the most severe fallacy of this project, but this would not affect the results too greatly given that the data would not change too much within 1 to 2 years if the accuracy of data is fully guaranteed.

shanghai_data lists prominent neighborhoods in Shanghai (in both English and Chinese) as well as the districts they belong to. It has three variables: District, Neighborhood and Neighborhood Chinese Name.

It is necessary to highlight that there is no such concept as "neighborhood" (社区) in Shanghai. "Neighborhood" is essentially a "western" concept and is not used to indicate the same thing in China. In the country, a "neighborhood" is more like a "residential community" (小区) that only has residential buildings rather than a large area that has shopping malls, stores, restaurants and attractions (and of course resdential communities). An equivalent concept, in Shanghai, is in fact "subdistrict" (街道).

"Subdistrict," however, is still not entirely the same as "neighborhood" in the western world. For instance, Wujiaochang (五角场) in Yangpu District is essentially a subdistrict ("五角场街道") in Shanghai's township-level divisions hierarchy and can be treated as a neighborhood to an extent. In contrast, the famous Xintiandi (新天地), an area full of delicacy, art, decent food and fashion in Huangpu District, is not a subdistrict but can be thought as a neighborhood.

Nevertheless, the report adopts the western convention and focuses on a total of 47 neighborhoods (subdistricts/towns) across 16 districts in Shanghai. The author built shanghai_data based on his own discretion.
